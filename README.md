# Q-Learning-for-navigation-in-a-house

## Introduction

In this project, I used Q-Learning for finding the best route to the outside of a house. This house has several rooms and the reward of exiting the house is +100 and this algorithm updates the Q-Table accordingly through several iterations.

## How to run the code

Download the "Qlearning.cpp" C++ code file and run it to return the updated Q-Table for this house.
